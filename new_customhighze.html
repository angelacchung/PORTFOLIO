                    <p> CustomHighze is a collaborative project that helps the user find the most appropriate
                        cannabis strain for them, based on their answers to the survey provided. We thought about
                        this idea when we knew that recreational use of cannabis was going to be legal in Ontario.

                    <p class="subtitle">THE PROBLEM</p>
                    <p>There are over approximately 700 known cannabis strains in the world. This is an overwhelming
                        large number. With so many varieties, it will be difficult for new users to understand and
                        know which strains are the right ones for them.

                <div class="section">
                    <p class="subtitle">THE SOLUTION</p>
                    <p>As a group, we developed the idea to create a survey that is dedicated to providing the most
                        fitting strain for the user, based on their answers. The web application also provides basic
                        information on strains, accessories and a link which leads to the official Ontario
                        government website about cannabis use. This is because our primary demographic aim is users
                        that are new/super casual.

                    <p>We then created an empathy map in order to understand our user better. By doing this, we had
                        a solid understanding of who we were designing for and what to look out for such as the pain
                        points. This became a guide on how we should design our web app. This also helped the team
                        further flesh out our web app idea.

                            I then worked with a fellow design team member to finalize and create the mock up
                            designs. We chose to go with a dominant red color and modern feel in order to stray away
                            from the traditional and formal look. We did not want our application to look bland
                            since we found that most cannabis users are in their 20-30s. We wanted to appeal to that
                            demographic.

                    <p>One of the problems we faced was definitely time. Everyone in our group except for one, had no
                        experience in web development prior to entering this program. Although we had many ideas we
                        wanted to include in the beginning, some of it had to be cut out. One of them was the tier 2
                        version of the survey. We later realized that the creation of the survey took longer than
                        expected, as well as the CSS of the website, due to most of us being inexperienced. From this
                        experience, we definitely learned a lot about web development.

                                After the final designs were done, we went around Sheridan College and asked students if they
                                would like to participate in our user testing. It was important for us to test this, in order to
                                gain insights on our design. We asked them how the interface felt and gave them tasks to complete.

                                    Half of the users experienced difficulty reading the content due to contrast and color

                                    A few expressed confusion on the survey questions and their relevance to the recommended
                                    strains

                                    Some also showed appreciation for the modern look and told us that they judge a website by
                                    how it looks; they would be less likely to continue staying on a web app if it looked boring
                                    or old
                                </li>

                        color blindness.
