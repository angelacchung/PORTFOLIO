            <h3 class="h3 subtitle">Summary</h3>
            <p class="mt-2">
                I had the opportunity to lead a UX audit of a client’s mobile app which focused on women’s health.
                For this UX audit, I analyzed the app’s google analytics data, the UX cam recordings, researched
                competitors and made recommendations on how they could improve their app. The client was particularly
                looking for ways on how to increase their user retention.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="wComp">
            <h3 class="h3 subtitle">The Problem</h3>
            <p>
                Along with some UI and UX issues, the client expressed that their user retention was not as high as they
                wanted it to be. They were also seeing that there were high drop off rates on some of their screens.
                After
                this UX audit, the client applied some of the recommendations and increased their user retention rate
                from 30% to 50%.

            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="wComp">
            <h3 class="h3 subtitle">The Solution</h3>
            <p>
                This audit was completed in the following phases: Data analysis, UX evaluation,
                Competitive Analysis, Recommendations and a mockup design.

            </p>

            <div class="wComp">
                <h3 class="h3 subtitle">Phase 1: Data analysis </h3>
                <p>
                    By collaborating with a fellow designer, I analyzed the behavior
                    flow report as well as the UX Cam recordings of the users. The behavior flow
                    report allowed us to see where users were dropping off from the app, which we took
                    note of in order to later find the answer as to why. The UX Cam recordings gave us some
                    insights into understanding how users were behaving on the app.
                </p>

                <p>We saw that users were dropping off the most from the following screens:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Articles screen (home screen)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Signup screen (onboarding)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Chat with doctor
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Chat standby screen
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    I was extra attentive to these screens when I went to examine the UX cam recordings.
                </p>
            </div>


            <div class="wComp">

                <h3 class="h3 subtitle">UX Cam observations</h3>

                <p>
                    My next step was to watch some recordings from UX Cam and see how users behave.
                    A few observations and UX issues that I found were:

                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In the chatroom, users were tapping on the doctor’s profile picture.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Doctors often have to ask their users to elaborate on their medical issue
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Adding a dosage for medicine is confusing. Here, UX Cam shows that the user is rage tapping the
                        screen.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I also observed that none of the UX Cam recordings showed users that were interested in
                    the articles. Some users also would just leave a chatroom in the middle of a conversation
                    with a doctor, possibly due to impatience.

                </p>

        <div class="wComp  headline">
            <h3 class="h3 subtitle">Phase 2: Analyzing for UX Issues</h3>
            <p>
                For phase 2, I analyzed for UX and UI issues on both Android and iOs devices. I found that:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Blog posts may be irrelevant to users’ needs and interests. As a result, it’s hard for the user to
                    identify the content they would want to read.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There is no clear indication that the user is being onboarded to chatting with a doctor.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Medication: If a user puts in a medication that is not from the drop down list (ex: Advil),
                    it looks like it has been added to the list but the button turns into a loading animation
                    and just keeps looping.
                </li>
                <li>
                    ‘Connecting you with a doctor’ popup can be exited but it takes you out of the queue which is
                    unexpected.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lack of giving the user a sense of progress being made
                </li>
            </ul>

                I then researched other apps that were in the same category. I looked into HealthTap,
                Doctors on Demand, Ada and Maple. The insights from this research helped me prepare
                recommendations on how the app could be improved.

            <p>
                It was challenging to conduct an analysis of the mobile app when I could not talk to
                their users. There were times when I was watching the UX Cam recordings and wished that
                I could ask the user why they did what they did. It was also a challenge for me to look
                into their Google analytics data since I had never done that before. If I had done this
                alone, I definitely would’ve been lost!

                After the UX audit was presented, the client applied a
