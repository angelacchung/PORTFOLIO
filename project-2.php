        <strong>Hold user testing sessions with two of the same types of web services and re-design one of them.</strong>
        <p class="mt-2">
        Domino‚Äôs is an American pizza chain that I analyzed along with two other 
        fellow designers. We held a user testing session for both Domino‚Äôs and Pizza 
        Pizza in order to compile data on pain points and what the user found effortless/liked. 
        We then proceeded with Domino‚Äôs for this case study. In this case study, we analyze the user 
        experience, the current interface design of the application and re-design it.

    We documented Domino‚Äôs current user flow when a user is ordering online for carryout in order 
    to have a visual.
    Based on the user's video recording and feedback, we then pinpointed areas where improvements should be made and re-designed the user flow.

            <p>I was tasked with creating the wireframes for the re-design. Based on the gathered information, I developed
              wireframe sketches and laid down what we wanted for each stage of the pizza-ordering process. I then took these
              sketches to mid-fidelity wireframes in order to further develop the re-design of the web application.
