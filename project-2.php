                <p class="subtitle">SUMMARY</p>
                <p>I had the opportunity to <strong> lead a UX audit of a mobile app</strong> which focused on women's
                    health and
                    connecting women to general health practitioners. My process consisted of analyzing the app’s google
                    analytics data, the UX cam recordings, researching competitors and making recommendations on how
                    they
                    could improve their app. The client particularly wanted to get <strong>emphasis on how to increase
                        user retention.</strong></p>
                <p>The scope for this audit was to analyze the app on both Android and iOS mobile devices within a 3
                    week period with a final presentation to the client, which included a userflow with the recommended
                    features that could be added into the app.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <p class="subtitle">PROBLEM</p>
                <p>
                    <strong> The app was experiencing issues with user retention rates as well as high drop off rates
                        from some of their screens.
                    </strong>The app also had UX/UI issues that were causing users confusion and frustration, which was
                    evident in the UX cam recordings.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <p class="subtitle">SOLUTION</p>
                <p>
                    The app was in need of a thoroughly conducted UX audit in order to pinpoint issues and how the app
                    could improve.
                    In order to improve the overall experience of the app, I made recommendations that resolved the
                    general UX/UI issues found
                    as well as suggest new features that could be implemented. These recommendations are based off of
                    analyzing user frustrations,
                    best UX practices and my research into other competitors.

            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <p class="subtitle">THE OUTCOMES</p>
                <p>After the UX audit was presented, the client applied a few of the recommendations
                    that I had made and saw that they had an <strong>increase in user retention from 30% to
                        50%.</strong>

                <p>By collaborating with a fellow designer,<strong> I analyzed the behavior flow report as well as
                        the
                        UX Cam recordings of the users. The recordings allowed me to observe the behavior of users as

            <p>It was challenging to conduct an analysis of the mobile app when I could not talk to
                their users. There were times when I was watching the UX Cam recordings and wished
                that I could ask the user why they did what they did. It was also a challenge for me
                to look into their Google analytics data since I had never done that before.

            <p class="subtitle">LEARNED OUTCOMES</p>
            <p>By the end of this audit, I learned how to better present and
                communicate my findings to the client (this was the first time that I have had
                to present my findings to a client!). This also made me look into
                other UX best practices and how to conclude on a recommendation.
                When presenting my recommendations, I had to back myself up and
                state why I think these solutions can work.
