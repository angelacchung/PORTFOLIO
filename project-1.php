                    <p>A responsive ecommerce site that a client was looking to bring to life. As the UX/UI Designer, I
                        was
                        <strong>responsible for this project</strong> and took it from the conceptual stages through the

                        into a finalized
                        prototype. The final deliverables were prototypes of the mobile and desktop designs, made with
                        InVision.

                            is not interested in the 3D house, they can still shop regularly.

                    A stumble that I faced for this project was that due to the restrictions of the project, user
                    research was not properly conducted. The information that I gathered for my user personas was based
                    off of what the client provided, as well as research that I did online. Ideally, I would’ve wanted
                    to interview real users.

                <p>At the end of this project, I further developed my skills and
                    understanding on how to work with Invision. Something new that I
                    learned was how to work with a client on further ideating the
                    idea and changing the project outlines mid-way. This was also a good challenge for me to take on
                    since
                    this is the first
                    time that I've ever worked on a project at this scale.
