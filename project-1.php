        <h3 class="h3 subtitle">Summary</h3>
        <p class="mt-2">
          CustomHighze is a collaborative project that helps the user find the most
          appropriate cannabis strain for them, based on their answers to the survey
          provided. We thought about this idea when we knew that recreational use of
          cannabis was going to be legal in Ontario.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wComp  headline">
      <h3 class="h3 subtitle">The Problem</h3>
      <p>
        There are over approximately 700 known cannabis strains in the world. This
        is an overwhelming large number. With so many varieties, it will be difficult
        for new users to understand and know which strains are the right ones for them.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="wComp  headline">
      <h3 class="h3 subtitle">The Solution</h3>
      <p>
        As a group, we developed the idea to create a survey that is dedicated to
        providing the most fitting strain for the user, based on their answers. The
        web application also provides basic information on strains, accessories and
        a link which leads to the official Ontario government website about cannabis
         use. This is because our primary demographic aim is users that are new/super casual.

  <p>We then created an empathy map in order to understand our user better.
    By doing this, we had a solid understanding of who we were designing for and
    what to look out for such as the pain points. This became a guide on how we should
    design our web app. This also helped the team further flesh out our web app idea. </p>

              This is the user flow that I created. For marketing purposes, the user can sign
              up for an account in order to be eligible for special offers such as discounts to
              local dispensaries. They can also send themselves their results in order to remember
               for next time, if they would like to try out the strain.

      <h3 class="h3 subtitle">The Wireframes</h3>
      <p>
          As a team, we created the low-fidelity wireframes together. Though this took a chunk of our time, it was a good opportunity
          for everyone to be on the same page of how this would get developed, where the problems lie and what needs or doesn't need to 
          be included. Discussing this project with our lead developer was important since we could discuss what was going to be hard/not possible
          and catch those obstacles in the early stages of our project.

        <h3 class="h3 subtitle">Final designs</h3>
        <p>
            I then worked with a fellow design team member to finalize and create the mock up designs. 
            We chose to go with a dominant red color and modern feel in order to stray away from the traditional 
            and formal look. We did not want our application to look bland since we found that most cannabis users 
            are in their 20-30s. We wanted to appeal to that demographic.

              <h3 class="h3 subtitle">The Stumbles</h3>
              <p>
                  One of the problems we faced was definitely time. Everyone
                  in our group except for one, had no experience in web development
                  prior to entering this program. Although we had many ideas we wanted
                  to include in the beginning, some of it had to be cut out. One of
                  them was the tier 2 version of the survey. We later realized that the
                  creation of the survey took longer than expected, as well as the CSS
                  of the website, due to most of us being inexperienced. From this experience,
                   we definitely learned a lot about web development.

            <div class="wComp  headline">
                <h3 class="h3 subtitle">Some user feedback</h3>
                <p>
                    After the final designs were done, we went around Sheridan College and asked students if 
                    they would like to participate in our user testing. It was important for us to test this, 
                    in order to see if our web application would make a user go “huh? what?”. That would tell us 
                    what kind of changes needed to be made. We asked them how the interface felt and gave them 
                    tasks to complete.
                </p>
                <p>Our findings</p>
                <ul class="pl-3 m-0" style="width:75%;">
                  <li>
                      Half of the users experienced difficulty reading the content due to contrast and color
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Many explained that they would not give in their e-mail  or create an account, since the rewards were not worth it
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      A few expressed confusion on the survey questions and their relevance to the recommended strains
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Some also showed appreciation for the modern look and told us that they judge a website by how it looks; 
                      they would be less likely to continue staying on a web app if it looked boring or old.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                  <p>
                      From the completion of this project, we now understand how long this process can take. 
                      We will now be more ready to tackle the next website project! We learned that it is important 
                      to make sure that the colors used - especially for text, are clearly legible and are accessible 
                      for color blindness.
