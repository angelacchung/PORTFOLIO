                        <p>I had the opportunity to lead a UX audit of a client’s mobile app which focused on women’s
                            health. I analyzed the app’s google analytics data, the UX cam recordings, researched their
                            competitors and made recommendations on how they could improve their app. The client was
                            particularly looking for ways on how to increase their user retention.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="text-center">

                    <div class="section">
                        <p class="subtitle">PROBLEM</p>
                        <p>Along with some UI and UX issues, the client expressed that their user retention was not as
                            high as they wanted it to be. They were also seeing that there were high drop off rates on
                            some of their screens.

                            After this UX audit, the client applied some of the recommendations and increased their user
                            retention rate from 30% to 50%.
                        </p>

                    <div class="section">
                        <p class="subtitle">SOLUTION AND SCOPE</p>
                        <p>I completed this audit in the following phases: Data analysis, UX evaluation, Competitive
                            Analysis, Recommendations and lastly, I showed the client a mockup design of what their app
                            could look like. The scope for this project was to analyze the mobile app on both Android
                            and iOS within a 2 week period and presenting it to the client.

                        <p>By collaborating with a fellow designer, I analyzed the behavior flow report as well as the
                            UX Cam recordings of the users. The behavior flow report allowed us to see where users were
                            dropping off from the app, which we took note of in order to later find the answer as to
                            why. The UX Cam recordings gave us some insights into understanding how users were behaving
                            on the app.

                        <p>
                            We saw that users were dropping off the most from the following screens:

                            their users. There were times when I was watching the UX Cam recordings and wished
                            that I could ask the user why they did what they did. It was also a challenge for me
                            to look into their Google analytics data since I had never done that before.
