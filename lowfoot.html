                        <p class="subtitle">SUMMARY</p>
                        <p>A client was looking for a re-design of their referrals dashboard in order to improve their
                            user experience and visual design. This referrals dashboard needed to be kept simple and
                            easy to understand. During the process of this redesign, the client changed their mind of
                            how they envisioned the new dashboard based on a competitor that I introduced in my
                            research. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="section">
                        <p class="subtitle">PROBLEM</p>
                        <p>The website had a few UX issues and the UI design was not as great as it could be. There were
                            also issues with the mobile design.

                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="section">
                        <p class="subtitle">THE PROCESS</p>
                        <p>My approach to this redesign was in the following phases: Empathy, Discovery, Structure, UI
                            and Usability Testing. I also had to keep in mind that this was a white-label product, so
                            the requirements were that the design had to include a primary, secondary and two accent
                            colors. However, the client was open to changing these requirements.

                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <h2 class="storyTitle"><span class="outline outlineTitle">In the beginning</span></h2>
                    <div class="section">
                        <p class="subtitle">EMPATHY</p>
                        <p>I started my research on affiliate marketers, which was the client’s targeted audience. Once
                            I felt like I had gathered enough information, I constructed a user persona and user journey
                            map of the current referral dashboard flow. This allowed me to emphasize and understand who
                            I was designing for, their needs and find pain points in the current flow.

                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="section">
                        <p class="subtitle">Discovery
                        </p>
                        <p>My next step was to research competitors and designs that are out in the world. The
                            competitors that I looked at were ReferralCandy, FirstPromoter and Airbnb’s referral
                            program.

                                                Therefore there is no dashboard or analytics. Airbnb handles the

                            that I could ask the user why they did what they did. It was also a challenge for me
                            to look into their Google analytics data since I had never done that before.
