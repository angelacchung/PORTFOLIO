        <h3 class="h3 subtitle">Summary</h3>
        <p class="mt-2">
          CustomHighze is a collaborative project that helps the user find the most 
          appropriate cannabis strain for them, based on their answers to the survey 
          provided. We thought about this idea when we knew that recreational use of 
          cannabis was going to be legal in Ontario. 
        </p>
    </div>    
    
    <div class="wComp">
      <h3 class="h3 subtitle">The Problem</h3>
      <p>
        There are over approximately 700 known cannabis strains in the world. This 
        is an overwhelming large number. With so many varieties, it will be difficult 
        for new users to understand and know which strains are the right ones for them.  
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="wComp">  
      <h3 class="h3 subtitle">The Solution</h3>
      <p>
        As a group, we developed the idea to create a survey that is dedicated to 
        providing the most fitting strain for the user, based on their answers. The 
        web application also provides basic information on strains, accessories and 
        a link which leads to the official Ontario government website about cannabis
         use. This is because our primary demographic aim is users that are new/super casual.

  <p>We then created an empathy map in order to understand our user better. 
    By doing this, we had a solid understanding of who we were designing for and 
    what to look out for such as the pain points. This became a guide on how we should 
    design our web app. This also helped the team further flesh out our web app idea. </p>

              local dispensaries. They can also send themselves their results in order to remember

              <p>
                  One of the problems we faced was definitely time. Everyone 
                  in our group except for one, had no experience in web development 
                  prior to entering this program. Although we had many ideas we wanted 
                  to include in the beginning, some of it had to be cut out. One of 
                  them was the tier 2 version of the survey. We later realized that the 
                  creation of the survey took longer than expected, as well as the CSS 
                  of the website, due to most of us being inexperienced. From this experience,
                   we definitely learned a lot about web development.
