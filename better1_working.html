                    <p class="subtitle">THE CHALLENGE</p>
                    <p>The client wanted to integrate a 3-D house or 3-D rooms into the shopping experience. This
                        3-D feature would not be the primary shopping experience, but rather for the purpose for
                        users to find inspiration/browse and to be set apart from competitors. This project was a
                        huge challenge for me, as I’ve never designed a project at this scale alone.

                <p class="subtitle">PERSONAS</p>
                <p>In order to understand who the targeted users were, I created 3 user personas based on the
                    information that the client provided. These user personas were visual guides that helped me
                    comprehend who I was designing for.

                </p>
                <p>The next step I took was taking these personas and creating user journey maps. These user
                    journey maps were based off of typical ecommerce shopping experiences. I used these as
                    visual maps in order to find and show the client where pain points are found. I also showed
                    them possible opportunities that could be implemented in each stage of the user journey
                    maps.

                            and
                            warm feel. I made sure to reflect this tone and also implemented moments that showed the
                            organization that they were 'curators' and that they cared about the customer.

                        <p> then created a user flow of the shopping experience. This online store would have two
                            shopping experiences: the 3D house and the regular shopping option. This is so if the user
                            is not interested in the 3D house, they can still shop regularly.

                <p>Based off of the user flow, I created a site map of the ecommerce store. This helped me keep
                    track of what screens will be in the site.

                    Once I had the user flow approved, I made the wireframes which I then turned into wireflows.
                    This was just to show to the client so they could have a visual map of how the ecommerce
                    store would work.

                    After some wireframe changes, the client provided their logo and colors. Based on
                    these assets, I moved on to create the UI designs.

                            concerned about the most and wanted to test for. For this prototype, I used Invision.

                    10 testers who fit within the persona molds were chosen for the usability test. This was
                    a good opportunity for me to get feedback on the 3D rooms shopping experience as well as
                    to catch anything I was missing. Some of the feedback that I got was:

                    <li>
                        Testers valued the 3D rooms because they could see the products and get a sense of scale
                        and how it could look in their homes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All testers understood what products were clickable because of the orange markings.

                    <li>
                        Testers wanted to know technical information and what would come with the purchase.

                <p>
                    A problem that I faced in this project was that user research was not properly conducted.
                    The information that I gathered for my user personas was based off of what the client
                    provided, as well as research that I did online. Other stumbles included keeping track when
                    designing screens since I was working on this alone.
