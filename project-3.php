        <h3 class="h3 subtitle">Summary</h3>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Beep Beep is a mobile carpooling app where users themselves can negotiate the trip, including the price. 
          The app characterizes itself as being a more environmentally friendly and inexpensive solution compared 
          to competing ride-sharing apps.

    <div class="mt-5 wComp  headline">
        <h3 class="h3 subtitle">The Problem</h3>
        <p class="mt-2">
          There are too many single car drivers on the road everyday and there needs to be a more affordable solution for carpooling. 
          Though public transportation and ride-sharing apps such as Uber and Lyft offer similar transit opportunities, they are expensive. 
        </p>

    <div class="mt-5 wComp  headline">
      <h3 class="h3 subtitle">The Goal</h3>
      <p class="mt-2">
        The goal is to significantly reduce the number of single passenger cars on the road as well as pair up riders with drivers. 
        We wanted to create a service that is not only economically beneficial for the users but also environmentally beneficial.

    <h3 class="h3 subtitle">Competitive Analysis</h3>
    <p>We analyzed other ride-sharing apps in order to further fuel our own ideas and understand the business of ride-sharing apps.

        We took a look at Uber and Lyft.</p>

      <p>After discussion on how we wanted our app to work, we created the user flow chart.</p>

  <h3 class="h3 subtitle">Don't wire alone</h3>
  <p>My team members and I then came together and actively further discussed features of the app while creating the low-fidelity wireframes.
    This was a good opportunity for us to flesh out our app and find problems such as why something would not work, how difficult it would be
    to code a certain component and how the database would be structured.

          <p>I then created some style tiles for the group to decide on. Using Google's color accessibility tool, I made sure that all the color palettes used were 
            accessible. We decided to go with the lighter green and blue style tile.

        <h3 class="h3 subtitle">The Stumbles</h3>
        <p>
          One of the stumbles we faced was confusion on what the app was and its features. There was a slight miscommunication on that part, which was resolved once we got to doing the low-fidelity wireframes together. For me, it was a realization on how important it is to 
          have everyone on the team together, discussing, fleshing out ideas and making sure that everyone understood the app. Another obstacle was time management and using a PHP framework that we were unfamiliar with.

      <div class="wComp headline">  
        <h3 class="h3 subtitle">Our learned outcomes</h3>
        <p>
          As a group, this project was a huge learning experience. We got to work with an unfamiliar framework and research into how to get certain components working such as the Google API. 
          As for me, I gained an opportunity to think critically and research into what sort of content was requried when it came to designing a ride-sharing app. This also gave me the challenge of how I would
          go about designing an app where a user could be both the rider and the driver.
