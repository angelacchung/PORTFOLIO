                <p class="subtitle">SUMMARY</p>
                <p> CustomHighze is a collaborative project that helps the user find the most appropriate
                    cannabis strain for them, based on their answers to the survey provided. We thought about
                    this idea when we knew that recreational use of cannabis was going to be legal in Ontario.

                <p class="subtitle">THE PROBLEM</p>
                <p>There are over approximately 700 known cannabis strains in the world. This is an overwhelming
                    large number. With so many varieties, it will be difficult for new users to understand and
                    know which strains are the right ones for them.

            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <p class="subtitle">THE SOLUTION</p>
                <p>As a group, we developed the idea to create a survey that is dedicated to providing the most
                    fitting strain for the user, based on their answers. The web application also provides basic
                    information on strains, accessories and a link which leads to the official Ontario
                    government website about cannabis use. This is because our primary demographic aim is users
                    that are new/super casual.

                    a solid understanding of who we were designing for and what to look out for such as the pain
                    points. This became a guide on how we should design our web app. This also helped the team
                    further flesh out our web app idea.

                        <p>A userflow was then created after collaborating with my team members. For marketing purposes,
                            the
                            user can sign up for an

                            They can also send themselves their results in order to remember for next time, if they
                            would like to try out the strain.

                <p> then created a user flow of the shopping experience. This online store would have two
                    shopping experiences: the 3D house and the regular shopping option. This is so if the user
                    is not interested in the 3D house, they can still shop regularly.

                        I then worked with a fellow design team member to finalize and create the mock up
                        designs. We chose to go with a dominant red color and modern feel in order to stray away
                        from the traditional and formal look. We did not want our application to look bland
                        since we found that most cannabis users are in their 20-30s. We wanted to appeal to that
                        demographic.

                    After the final designs were done, we went around Sheridan College and asked students if they
                    would like to participate in our user testing. It was important for us to test this, in order to
                    gain insights on our design. We asked them how the interface felt and gave them tasks to complete.

                    <li>
                        Half of the users experienced difficulty reading the content due to contrast and color

                        Some also showed appreciation for the modern look and told us that they judge a website by
                        how it looks; they would be less likely to continue staying on a web app if it looked boring
                        or old

                <p class="subtitle">THE STUMBLES</p>
                <p>One of the problems we faced was definitely time. Everyone in our group except for one, had no
                    experience in web development prior to entering this program. Although we had many ideas we
                    wanted to include in the beginning, some of it had to be cut out. One of them was the tier 2
                    version of the survey. We later realized that the creation of the survey took longer than
                    expected, as well as the CSS of the website, due to most of us being inexperienced. From this
                    experience, we definitely learned a lot about web development.
